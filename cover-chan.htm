                                <p class="mt-0">In addition to motor, food and consumer goods are also our important business segments in the mainland. Mr Chen Yun, General Manager of DCH China Food and China Logistics, shared some of his views concerning the 2022 business plan.</p>
                                <h5 class="mt">Reshaping DCH China Food's <span class="lg-break"></span> "Extraordinary 6+1" Program</h5>
                                <p>During the interview, Mr Chen first laid out the "Extraordinary 6+1" plan, which includes the staple food business of pre-made dishes in the food industry. "DCH possesses raw materials, factories, and software and hardware for making sales, and has an edge of making pre-made dishes. We hope to place importance on speed and produce products within three months to drive the sales of related products." In addition, China Foods will also further develop dealerships and private brands, through participation in entry-level exhibitions to form a powerful sales system.</p>
                                <p>Mr Chen also said that China Foods will continue to integrate 2B and 2C businesses and encourage teams to learn about e-commerce so as to bring consumers closer to products. At the same time, the catering business will be strengthened since catering is an important contact point with consumers. In addition, the joint venture company Shanghai Zhongxin Marketing Development Co., Ltd. will also focus more on channels and become a distributor for Japanese products, especially for frozen products. Meanwhile, a DCH self-controlled retail platform will be established and terminal retail stores will be opened to establish 2C format and investment will be placed in strengthening the supply chain. It is hoped that the "Extraordinary 6+1" plan will effectively reshape DCH China Food, so that the business will continue to innovate and make breakthroughs.</p>

                                <p>During the interview, Mr Chen mentioned that DCH China Consumer Products launched the McKinsey Transformative Operation Project in 2018, which designed and released a brand-new organizational structure with the characteristics of a huge system and a small sharp knife. With the shared support of the huge system, the market expansion and channel marketing of small sharp knives are empowered. With reference to the continuation of the transformative operation project, digitalizing supply chain will be seen as the core starting from 2020 and the construction of a digital business platform will be the first step in the digital transformation of DCH China Consumer Products. </p>
                                <p> "The first phase of the digital supply chain will be launched in 2021 to realize the process of supply chain’s reform: strengthening the inventory monitoring and timely forewarning of the whole chain to reduce risky inventory, and reduce the operating cost of enterprises with high-level supply chain management; fully pondering and combining the characteristics and business features of DCH (China) Consumer Products so as to realize the point-to-point real-time visualization of the whole supply chain under the digital supply chain management model. On this basis, we shall dynamically adjust and manage according to the plan, and further attain control over the full chain of inventory and commodities.”</p>

                                <p>This year, under the policies of the national "14th Five-Year Plan", we have finalised DCH's "14th Five-Year Plan" of informatization and digital development plan. With "focusing on key points", "promoting the transformation of new retail business", "implementing the blue ocean project", “digital transformation” and “new retail of food O2O”, we can accelerate digital strategy’s construction.</p>
                                <p>Mr Chen also mentioned that starting from this year, the digital transformation of China Consumer Products will start from an inflexible system with a data hierarchy that is single-interfaced and complex and develop towards a more open and integrated ecosystem that will be collaborative both internally and externally. The aspect concerning the clients will be more interconnected, informative and engaged. In terms of collaboration with manufacturers, exchange of information and business collaboration will become more flexible. As regards internal process, we will open up and innovate so as to construct a more comprehensive and self-adjusting procedure for processing business, and speed up business development and promotion. </p>
                                <p>"Digital transformation is the redefinition of business (process, scenario, relationship, employee); reengineering of application (optimization and improvement); internal completion of being fully online so as to realize the external adaptation to various changes from the front end to the back end and attain full implementation of automation and intellectualization that will not require manual intervention, and will ultimately create value for the enterprise.”</p>

                                        <h5>Fully implements automation and intellectualization<br>Creates value for enterprises
                                        </h5>
                                        <p>Mr Chen said that automation is about making point-to-point business online and automated. The relationship between departments is shaped into a "parallel" model in the system, which strengthens the interconnection and interoperability inside and outside the enterprise, and improves the relationship among the enterprise, suppliers and clients so as to enable direct contact between departments and their clients. In this regard, changes in clients’ needs can also be directly conveyed to various departments and enterprises through the internet, which can improve efficiency and reduce risks while providing fast responses.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>"Intellectualization refers to the construction of a large and medium-sized information platform driven by numbers, and obtaining data in real time through multiple channels so as to realize point-to-point visibility of the supply chain, making it visible, clear, and complete; maximizing the use of information and to provide key performance indicators, risk warnings, and forecast recommendation through big data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. All these lay the foundation for intelligent decision-making. Decision-making matters drive the adjustments in business execution, bringing fundamental changes to operations of the supply chain, and building operating models for point-to-point supply chain which shall be optimized continuously.”

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Mr Chen also said that according to the latest three-year plan for digital strategy’s construction, the construction of the prototype of the dealers’ platform will be completed within this year, and the dealers’ inventory data and business data will be merged and studied so as to foster sales operations. A private domain membership platform will be built, online and offline membership rights will be opened up, exclusive membership system will be established, members’ loyalty will be forged, and repurchase will be augmented. Online channel’s operations such as self-built malls, B2C platforms, and live broadcasts will also be strengthened.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>"In 2023, we will continue to deepen the construction of CRM modules in the private domain member management model (SCRM), and perfect the construction of functional modules such as dealers’ ordering, reconciliation, and dealers’ development. A functional model for supplier relationship management system (SRM) will be initially built to achieve online reconciliation, integrated management of online platforms such as supply and demand planning and to achieve balance between supply and demand.  Automatic balance between distribution plans and changes in sales forecast in each profit’s centre will be attained.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>After completing the two-year digital transformation where the system has been integrated and the functional modules have been improved, it is expected that backstage data will be integrated in 2024 and a data centre, data labels and artificial intelligence will be built. Early warning of data will become applicable so as to enable the application of big data on the platform in the data centre. At the same time, a graphical report can be built to help promote business development and business decision-making. "
