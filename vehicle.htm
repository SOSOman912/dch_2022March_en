                                    <p class="mt-0"> Honda Hong Kong has always attached great importance to communication with car owners as the brand value is built upon the satisfaction of customers. In November 2021, we invited three voluntary Honda car owners to hold a gathering for fans, and even co-organized with DCH Motor Parts to enhance the synergy between us.</p>
                                    <p>Starting off was the new generation of JAZZ, for which we held a car gathering for the first time, including JAZZ CROSSTAR, JAZZ EX and the hybrid version of JAZZ e:HEV. There was also a demo car equipped with a full set of "MUGEN" parts, catching the eyes of many car owners. At the event, we hosted a briefing session on the e:HEV Honda new generation hybrid system to equip car owners with information on use and maintenance. After the event was over, car owners shared the event on various social platforms, which greatly ameliorated our relationship with customers.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, we invited Honda Owner Alliance (HOA) and MUGEN RR for a car gathering, with more than 100 cars participating, and the scene was stupendous. In addition to displaying Honda models of different generations, there were also the global limited edition MUGEN RR, the final edition FD2 RC and the yellow limited edition Type R FK8, satisfying the craving of hungry fans. DCH Motor Parts also launched different exquisite products of "MUGEN" and body kit discounts. Car owners were very impressed by the arrangement of this event and they had so much.</p>

Residents will only need to download the mobile app, and the entire car rental process can be completed automatically, easily and quickly. The electric vehicles provided can also contribute to the team's endeavour in environmental protection and sustainable development. In the future, the team will expand the car-sharing service to different domains such as large shopping malls, public parking lots and commercial facilities, making the car-sharing service within grasp and the service will be made available all across Hong Kong.</p>
