                                    <p>International Gourmet Foods (IGF) set up a booth at the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo 2021, selling all kinds of foods such as sausages, cold cut, smoked salmon and ready-to-eat products from Leo’s Fine Food and Bayern Gourmet Foods. During the exhibition, the sales team and promoters worked hard to introduce our products to every potential customer. Popular products such as Norwegian smoked salmon, Premium assorted sausage combo, Lamb stew pot and German style BBQ pork, etc. were well received by customers. IGF also launched a limited-edition Lucky grab bag to attract more visitors and try our products. Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lai, our Chief Executive Officer, and all colleagues who visited the booth for rendering their personal support.

                                    <p>The deceased Baron Philip de Rothschild, owner of Château Mouton Rothschild (one of the five Premier Grand Cru in Bordeaux), tasted the Chateau Grand Mayne Saint-Emilion 1955 at a restaurant in Belgium and immediately exchanged the wine with a few boxes of Château Mouton Rothschild 1955, mirroring the excellence and value of the Château Grand Mayne premium wine. </p>
                                    <p>Today, the winery has won several awards on multiple occasions for its fine wines, and the 2015 vintage even garnered an impressive score of 92 or above from various world-renowned wine critics, including Robert Parker and James Suckling. </p>

I was only able to taste this one time, but wow, what a wine.” — Jeb Dunnuck, Well-known Wine Critics

                        <div class="text-blk-1 first">

                                    <p>Miyoshikiku Brewery was founded in 1889. Produced with strictly selected Yamada-Nishiki, king of sake-rijst (the rice used for sake brewing), the first-class soft fukuryusui water from Yoshino River, one of Japan's three most famous rivers, and Tokushima’s yeast. Products from Miyoshikiku Brewery have a gorgeously floral fragrance with a scent of fresh fruit. The taste is fresh and smooth! </p>
                                    <p>Miyoshikiku Jyunmai Daiginjyo has always been the best-seller since DCH started the distribution last year. Beside using Yamada-Nishiki from Tokushima with seimaibuai level of 40%, the method of "Fukuro-tsuri" (Drip-sake) method is also employed. </p>
                                    <p>"Fukuro-tsuri”  is made from only drops by gravity from moromi (fermentation mush) in a hanged filter bag. No pressing by pressure. The elegant fragrance and fascinating taste are created only from drops. Since the filtration method is time-consuming with sacrce output, “Fukuro-tsuri” is generally used for high-end wines. The sake produced can retain more original flavours, accentuating the wine’s fragrance or rich texture. The taste is sweet, delicate, with a sense of purity with smooth texture. This is a dreamy masterpiece among sakes. </p>
