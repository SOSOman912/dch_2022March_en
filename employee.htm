About 80 colleagues successfully donated blood, showing the spirit of selfless dedication. The event was successfully held thanks to the enthusiastic blood donation from all colleagues and their contributions to the Hong Kong Red Cross. We take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to every enthusiastic colleague. We look forward to your participation in the next blood donation day and to join in the good deeds.</p>

The program attracted nearly 40 teams, with over 100 people signing up, and the responses were overwhelming. The planting period started at the end of last year, and the harvest has been obtained, giving colleagues a taste of the joy of farming in the city.</p>

In addition to the individual awards, we also added a team award, hoping that colleagues can form a team to "synchronize in walking" in their spare time to enhance team spirit. During the two-week competition, in addition to the daily multi-stair walk, the teams also went out for excursions in the countryside in their spare time in an attempt to increase the number of steps.</p>
                                    <p>This competition attracted more than 50 teams to participate. In the end, the Motor business won the "Most Active Participation Award" and "Department’s Overall Champion" with 20 participating teams and over 9.74 million steps; and the overall champion team was Auriga's team. Mr Ko Wing Kam of Auriga won the "Individual Walking King" with more than 370,000 steps.</p>

                                    <p>As a responsible company, DCH has been caring for the society for many years. For example, the DCH’s volunteering team has cooperated with the Hong Kong Red Cross to regularly hold "blood donation activities" at the DCH headquarters, fulfilling its civic obligations in donating blood to help others; in addition, we participated in the "Flag Raising Activities for Fundraising” held by large charitable organizations, inspiring colleagues to participate in more charitable activities and feel the happiness from performing good deeds. We also joined hands with the CITIC Hong Kong and Macau Staff Association to participate in activities that cared for the community, visiting grassroots and elderly families, distributing lucky bags, providing basic necessities and anti-epidemic supplies such as rice, oil and masks, so as to disseminate messages of caring for the community.</p>
                                    <p>DCH has always been committed to providing customers with quality products and services. At the same time, it also shoulders the mission of promoting sustainable social development and conveys love with actions. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the nomination from the Hong Kong Lutheran Social Service. In the future, we will continue to work with people from different sectors and social service organizations to further practise corporate social responsibility and work together to care for the community.</p>
