                                    <h3>China motor keeps pace with the market <br> Outlining a new blueprint for development
                                    </h3>
                                    <p class="mt-0">Entering the motor sector in mainland China in 1979, DCH has accumulated over 40 years of experience in the field of motor business. Serving as the dealer and distributor for over 20 motor brands and operating over 110 4S shops and urban showrooms, DCH is one of the top-notch motor dealers in the China. In this issue of “DCH Connect”, we are very honoured to have Mr LI Chen Di, Jonathan, corporate director and head of China motor, accept our invitation to share his thoughts on how to maintain high-quality, the planning of China motor’s prospect in 2022 and how to utilize digitalisation in transformation. </p>
                                    <h5 class="mt">Insists on serving with ingenuity to seize client’s heart</h5>
                                    <p>Mr Li said, “Currently, the Chinese automobile market has evolved from ‘incremental competition’ to ‘stock competition’. Under ‘stock competition’, ‘placing priority on products’ is no longer the only way of competing. As various motor dealers are striving to make internal improvements, they also understand the importance of seizing the heart of clients in order to get hold of the pulse of the era.”</p>
                                    <p>“The root of market’s competition is indeed a contest to fight for clients. Whether it is the products or services, client’s satisfaction is the key to success. Satisfaction represents consumer experience and recognition from clients can only be acquired by providing them with quality experiences. This can augment the power and influence for the brand’s future.</p>
                                    <p>DCH motor serves with the motto of ‘serving with ingenuity & conveying bliss’. From the very beginning, we have continued to raise the soft power of providing services and improve proactively.”</p>

                                <div class="col-md-6">
                                    <h5>All-round online and offline coordination<br> Strengthens client’s loyalty</h5>
                                    <p>Mr Li pointed out that in the aspect of providing services, DCH motor keeps innovation afloat and launches various novel measures to “pamper its fans”. Launched in 2022, the “monthly service day” demonstrates our insistence on returning to the core of our service and the principle of placing the top priority on our users. Through delicacy services and relevant discounting policies, customers are able to fully indulge in the perfect consumer experience while using their cars.</p>
                                    <p> “In terms of online service, DCH motor has been keeping pace with time and continues to innovate. We place focus on female car owners and young clients of the new generation in order to cater to the trend and step out of the usual boundary. Through the eye-catching modes of live streaming e-commerce on ‘Bingo．Prosperity’ and welfare of pampering online fans, together with the high-end road trip of “experiential masters” of car owners’ club, charitable activities (environmental protection and caring for children and elderly) and the derivative trendy stuff (surprise for exchanging cars, gift post-sales and birthday present to car owners), users are provided with a platform to in terms of car maintenance, aesthetic beatification, colourful culture of daily life and other top-up services. For instance, car owners will automatically earn points when they purchase maintenance at our stores and the points fully support the 100% redemption of gifts and working-hour vouchers. We reward car owners with tangible, monetary top-up services so as to strengthen their loyalty.”</p>
                                    <p>“As regards the offline attitude towards customers, DCH has begun to implement ‘smiles on all employees’ in all our stores in 2021. With our amicable attitude and unique way of treating our customers, we resonate with the needs of our clients and build up a deep emotional connection and recognition. This enables the users to truly feel the sincerity and quality of DCH services.”</p>

                                    <p>Mr Li also mentioned that the core of ‘serving with ingenuity & conveying bliss’ is to understand the need of clients attentively and ensure that every little detail which could impress and surprise our client shall be done with perfection.

                                    <p>Although the outside world believed that the car dealer industry will enter an era of “negligible” profits, Mr Li expressed, “Dealers should refine their delicacy management and firmly grasp the chance for users to upgrade the maintenance services after sales and develop second-hand motor business. If we can seize the moment to explore new opportunities, the foundation for survival and development can still be tightly cemented. China motor will succeed the revolutionary pathway from 2021 and join forces with McKinsey & Company introduced by DCH to continuously bolster the effectiveness of delicacy management in terms of superb operation.”</p>
                                    <p>Right now, the traditional motor selling mode is facing an arduous challenge like never before and products and skills are being upgraded incessantly. With the ever-changing market structure and consumer needs, channels are bound to undergo revolution. Whether it is the new-energy driven cars, electric cars of traditional brands or diesel cars of traditional brands, sales models such as channel’s innovation, attempt at running direct stores and dealerships are being carried out and multi-channel sales are further explored in a bid to seek the point of balance between user experience and cost effectiveness. Traditional motor sales model is now entering the wave of revolution and China motor will ultimately uphold the ideals of shared business, shared construction and shared ideas in order to pioneer a new game in the midst of changes.</p>
                                    <p>China Motor's “14th Five Year Plan” has been launched, and the next five years will be focused on becoming "an enterprise that leads in the new era’s market and offers customer-first mobile travel solutions”, with the focus placed on Southern and Southwest China’s markets and luxury brands. While integrating internal and external resources to explore new retail business, we shall continue to establish four core capabilities: the operational ability to lead consumers’ journey, efficient operational ability that leads the industry, ability to exploit new business with rapid iterative operation and a system of organizational culture that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation</p>
                                    <p>“In the future, China motor will always keep pace with the pulse of the market. Together with motor manufacturers, we shall make consumer demand our core and seek steady progress amid the waves of revolution and continue to sail forward.”</p>

                                    <p>As the proportion of new energy vehicles continues to increase, consumer demand has become increasingly diversified and individualistic, speeding up the process of digital transformation which are crucial for dealers to enhance their core competitiveness. Mr Li pointed out that the current construction of the digital system for dealers is mostly limited to making digital records of the process of operation without the understanding about the users and lacking the ability to plan digital construction from a comprehensive perspective.</p>
                                    <p>“MCL's current digital transformation is a three-step strategy. The first step, targeting business informatization, has been tentatively completed with the use of digital technology to assist various business departments to reduce costs and increase efficiency. In the medium and short terms, the second step will see MCL striving to realize the Internet of system integration, focusing on the four major modules of digital system upgrade, improvement of membership system, optimization of channel streaming, and digital marketing. This can further realize the interchangeability of system data in different business departments and apply the interchanged data in the business end.</p>
                                    <p>In the third step, from the perspective of long-term development, we focus on intellectualizing the system through digital upgrades, providing employees with tools for data collection, management and visual presentation which are more intelligent and personalized. At the same time, MCL’s existing customers’ data is better utilized to provide bottom-tier support for digital transformative business.”</p>
                                    <p>“The improvement of the digital membership system will accurately respond to customer needs through the upgrade of the existing membership system and the establishment of a digital community system so as to improve customer satisfaction, participation and loyalty. Channel streaming’s optimization aims to improve traditional vertical media’s streaming effect through optimization of channel options and projection’s strategy; by opening up new media channels, stores are set up and brand benefits are established, catalysing the conversion of consumers from potential customers to users. </p>
                                    <p>In terms of digital marketing, starting from the two directions of sales and after-sales, the integrity and transparency of customers’ data on the sales end will improve the conversion rate. On the other hand, we shall try to reduce the churn rate of existing customers at the after-sales end and achieve accurate marketing of existing customers.”</p>
                                    <p>At last, Mr Li mentioned that in the next five-year development plan of MCL, intellectualization of services will be realized on the basis of data accumulation and technological advancement. Using cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, we shall continue to provide better services to our customers and create greater value for the group.</p>
