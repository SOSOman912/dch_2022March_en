                                        <p class="mt-0">We have been awarded the "Employer of Choice Award" by JobMarket for the first time, which is a testament to our high performance in strategic work concerning talents. The award is not only a recognition and encouragement to us, but also enhances the professional and outstanding image of DCH in the industry, which is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement.</p>
                                        <p>DCH regards its employees as an important asset and employees’ development is an integral part of our business. Over the years, we have invested in our employees for them to unleash their potential through training and development programs, on-the-job coaching and business exposure. We organize experiential training workshops, interactive sharing sessions and leadership development programs as well as provide online and mobile learning resources and learning libraries for our employees to accelerate their professional and personal to development. </p>
                                        <p>One of the most important aspects of nurturing talents for an enterprise is staff training, which strengthens the cohesion of the teams with common values ​​shared between the enterprise and its employees. In 2021, DCH augmented efforts to expand the scope and scale of staff training, providing more than 30 different types of training courses to employees. In addition, DCH has also built a structured development path for junior staff and trainees, junior, middle and senior management to achieve an unparalleled inheritance across generations and develop a talent pipeline.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, DCH has been cooperating well with the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education for many years to provide a comprehensive motor repair apprenticeship program to recruit young people who are interested in joining the motor repair industry.</p>
                                        <p>DCH also integrates concepts of environmental, social and corporate governance into its management and operation model, which not only enhances our long-term competitive advantage, but also helps build a society capable of sustainable development. For example, we conducted about 200 safety inspections in 2021 in a bid to identify potential safety hazards at every single workplace and make immediate improvements; we also conducted energy conservation and waste reduction in various aspects, including waste management, energy management, lighting systems and water and wastewater management, etc.</p>
                                        <p> In the future, DCH is not afraid of challenges and will continue to uphold its corporate values. It is not only committed to continuously cultivating outstanding talents for the society, but also motivating employees to move forward together with a structured talent development framework.</p>

In order to enable colleagues to learn and innovate incessantly, Group IT not only holds "Lunch & Learn" and "Idea Sharing Activities" regularly, but also held the " Election of Excellent Staff in Learning" recently, selecting and rewarding colleagues who have achieved the most certifications in 2021, thereby encouraging other colleagues to continue to learn and upgrade their own skills.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, Group IT also organizes "Team Building” activities from time to time to enhance team spirit and efficiency. Recently, Group IT and Group Services Division visited Microsoft Smart Office Experience Centre which allowed them to try the products in person, hoping that DCH will become more modern and intelligent inside and out in the future, and at the same time, the productivity of our employees can be further enhanced.</p>
